# movie-lookup-site

I created a website that uses a form and the OMDb API to look up movie information and display it to users.

It validates all input fields and displays error messages for any incorrect form input.

If all fields are correct, query the API using the inputs and disable all form fields and buttons.

If a result is found, the title, year, rating, release date, and poster (if available) of the first movie or show are displayed beneath the search form.

If there are no results, an error message stating that what they searched for could not be found appears beneath the search form.
